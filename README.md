# Team-7

This is the repository that will contain all our work for this project.

The `native` folder contains the code, tests and libraries for the desktop app. To execute the desktop application, run the class ca.mcgill.ecse321.team7.application.FoodTruckManager. If you want to see the code in Eclipse, you have to create a project and make its root folder point to the `native` folder of this repository.

The `android` folder contains the code, tests and libraries for the Android app. To execute the Android application, run the class ca.mcgill.ecse321.team7.foodtruckmanagementsystem.StartActivity. To see the code in Android Studio, you just need to import the project since all the project files are on the repository.

The `web` folder contains the code, tests and libraries for the web app. It is also the root folder of the server.

All the general files (such as the Umple file are at the root of this repository).
